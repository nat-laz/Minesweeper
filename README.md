## Game Exercise: Minesweeper

### Objective:

- Create a console-based Java game that simulates the classic "Minesweeper" game. The player uncovers cells on a grid
  while avoiding hidden mines.

### Game Rules:

- The game is played on a grid where some cells contain mines.
- The player's objective is to uncover all safe cells without hitting any mines.
- If the player uncovers a mine, the game ends.

### Game Features:

- The program will generate a grid with mines and numbers indicating the number of neighboring mines for each cell.
- The player can select a cell to uncover. If it's a mine, the game ends.
- If the cell is safe, the program will reveal the number of neighboring mines or empty space.
- The game will end when the player either uncovers all safe cells or uncovers a mine.

### User Interaction:

- The program should interact with the player through the console.
- The player will input the row and column to uncover a cell (e.g., "row 3, column 4").
- The program will display the grid and reveal cells as the game progresses.

### Game End:

- The game ends when the player uncovers all safe cells or when they uncover a mine.
- The program will display a message indicating whether the player won or lost.
